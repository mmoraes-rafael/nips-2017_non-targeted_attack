# NIPS 2017 - Adversarial Attack

This folder contains the files used in my final submission to the [NIPS 2017: Non-targeted Adversarial Attack](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nips-2017-non-targeted-adversarial-attack) competition, hosted by Kaggle in association with Google Brain.

This code was placed **19th** out of 91 teams (**Top 21%**), as can be seen in [my Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/rafaelmm/competitions).

These files are derived from the [cleverhans](https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans) library, developed by Ian Goodfellow and hosted at TensorFlow's repo. The Inception checkpoint was trained by Google and provided online.
